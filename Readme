### **Description:**
This interactive proportional symbol map, built using Leaflet, demonstrates the Texas Tornado activity The Texas Association of Amateur Tornado Watchers (TAATW)
by county and Texas Emergency GIS Response (EGRT) Regions for a 5 year period for 2015-2020.

The TAATW would like to have your team generate a recent five-year window of tornado activity
showing past locations by county, with an interactive map with a slider for each year of the 5
years of tornado activity in Texas from 2015-2020. The drop-down tool will allow the selection of
one or more of the six EGRT Regions. Each historical tornadic event will have an interactive
popup that contains basic information on the Date, EF Rating, Property Damage Cost in Dollars,
injuries, Fatalities, Length in miles and County location. Calculating a county polygon of standardized density
per 1,000 square miles (2015-2020) will lend itself to users discovering which areas have the
most significant damage. The base maps of Open Street Map for roads/urban areas, ESRI World
Imagery, World Shaded Relief and Topo Maps with Contours can be utilized for direct field use.
